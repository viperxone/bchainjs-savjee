Blockchain development in Javascript

I followed Savjee tutorials and heavily commented the files. Different "main" from different parts of the video tutorial. "main.js" is from part 4 transaction tutorial. "main-4-Trans" will contain the comment where the codes were cut to be paste on blockchain.js.

Need to install node.js. Folder need to contain "node_modules" folder.
